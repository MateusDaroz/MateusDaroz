#About me
<hr>
My name is Mateus Daroz, I have 18 years and I'm studying at Col√©gio T√©cnico de Limeira (COTIL), on my second year of course at the moment. I'm in love with the technollogy area since my 6 years, while I was playing in the computer, and from this time to today, I always was trying to find new knowledges and something that combines with me, and it's here where the programming goes on.
