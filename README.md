### About me

My name is Mateus Daroz, I'm 18 years, and I'm studying System's Development at the Colégio Técnico de Limeira (COTIL) in my second year of course. I'm in love with the technology area since my 6 years, while I was playing in the computer, and from this time to today, I was always trying to find new knowledge and something that combines with me, and it's here where the programming enters.
